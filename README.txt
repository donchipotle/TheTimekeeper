Hello! Thank you for playing my lousy ASCII roguelike!
With that out of the way, a few things to note:

	This program utilizes the library Pygame. You 
can find distributions (for more or less) whatever 
platform you may have at https://www.pygame.org/
This is tentative until I figure out how to distribute
everything, if that ever happens.

	Currently, you will need to create a folder
called "savegame" in the root directory of the game,
as it is essential for the saving system to function.
This will hopefully fixed in later 	

	Your framerates may drop in areas where many
 tiles are rendered. This is normal, and subject to
future optimization. Because all turns are executed at
once and reaction times do not matter in the slightest, 
this should not be a major issue for anyone. Leave the 
FPS monitor off if it bothers you that much.

	You may edit game settings in the settings.py 
file. It is worth noting that the camera speed may be 
adjusted if you want to snap to the player's spawn 
location.

	Future and in-progress work will be posted in 
the project's official Trello at
