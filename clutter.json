							its humanity - has somehow twisted into a demented, repugnant beast. You do not and cannot understand what could have happened to 
							the image - surely, surely, it could not have been painted this way, nor could it have been so well defiled by another.
							In the corner, barely legible, is the artist's signature: Безіл Холлуорд"
