This are external assets or inspirations from other creators.

Gameplay and design are strongly influenced by the Hacklikes/Roguelikes Omega and NetHack, 
though I hope, without the former's inventory system and the latter's keyboard-smashing, 
gut-wrenching, Halo's LASO's one-upping difficulty.

ASCII characters, names, items, locations and even some monsters all find inspirational roots
in Ukrainian culture, alphabet, etc. As a non-Ukrainian who at the time of writing this has 
not personally visited there, it's probably pathetic in the eyes of someone who knows better
than I do, but oh well. For example, the Cyrillic Ð¯ (used to represent the player) is 
commonly used in Ukraine and Russia for the first person, singular pronoun "I." Fun fact.

The House of Pages is very, very strongly inspired by Mark Danielewski's novel House of Leaves.
Why? Well, why not? I'm bored and I needed ideas for a dungeon.

The Nightcrawlers in the dungeon are inspired by the Fresno Nightcrawler, an infamous
cryptid.

Massive shoutout to The Terrible Programmer on YouTube, whose Python tutorial series helped 
immensely, as well as to commenters and other resources who aided in debugging things like  
deprecation issues. Since I'm a moron who isn't fit for programming even a Hello World, 
none of this would have been possible without them.
