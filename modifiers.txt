	These are modifiers which will make The Timekeeper stupidly unfair, and
can be enabled in settings.py.
	You will not have fun.

#1: NOSING AROUND
	Have fun gawking at your surroundings while enemies hack, slash, stab, 
poison, burn and bludgeon you and devour your soul! Examining your surroundings 
costs you a turn. Being nosy does not pay.

#2: DISORGANIZED
	Oh, and opening your inventory now costs you a turn too. Maybe next time 
you'll learn to, oh, I don't know... ACTUALLY PREPARE FOR FIGHTS AHEAD OF TIME?

#3: BAD LUCK
	Oh boy. Enemy combat rolls are biased against you. But what about your
rolls? Don't worry, they're biased against you too. Forgive me for saying this, 
but... Good luck.

#4: YOU AND WHAT ARMY?
	With some exceptions, such as unique characters, enemy spawns are doubled.
Hallelujah, it's raining Nightcrawlers!

#5: ALL ABOARD THE PAIN TRAIN
	Incoming and outgoing damage is doubled for every single character in the 
game, including you. CHOO CHOO!!!

#6: YOU DONE GOOFED
	Like a good roguelike, permadeath is there!

#7: 

(spells do damage to caster and target, includig player? idk)
